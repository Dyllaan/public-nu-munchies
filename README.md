# Northumbria Web Team Project - Food Waste

This project requires Docker, Node JS, PHP and an internet connection to connect to the Supabase
Database and to connect to the Email server which handles sending of emails.

All required libraries are included in main, and as such it is a large file size, but this makes installation very easy.
In the backend folder run
"docker-compose up" to start the backend
which will be available at localhost:8080

For the frontend run "npm run dev" in the frontend folder (or using your preffered package manager such as yarn or bun.)
It will be hosted at localhost:3000

The Backend requires the Firebase Library for JWT tokens

The backend is accesible via:
https://backend.nu-munchies.xyz

The frontend is accessible via
